# Platos_Pizzeria_Analysis

üè≠ Project Overview:
Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey, sought to enhance their operations using data-driven insights. The owner's primary focus was on sales performance, busy periods, seating capacity utilization, and product performance. Leveraging data visualizations, I developed a comprehensive report that provided an overview of the restaurant's performance and identified areas for improvement.

I worked with sets of information in tables:
Orders: This had the dates and times when people ordered from their tables.
Order Details: It listed the types of pizzas people ordered and how many of each.
Pizzas: This table had info about pizza sizes, prices, and types.

Here are the main things I found:
1. There are two peak times ‚Äì during lunch and dinner. Fridays are the busiest days.
2. Not many orders come in before 11 am or after 10 pm. It might be worth checking if it's worth staying open longer.
3. The Brie Carre pizza isn't popular and uses uncommon ingredients. Removing it might help manage stock better.

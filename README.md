üè≠ Project Overview:
Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey, sought to enhance its operations using data-driven insights. The owner's primary focus was on sales performance, busy periods, seating capacity utilization, and product performance. Leveraging data visualizations, 
I developed a comprehensive report that provided an overview of the restaurant's performance and identified areas for improvement.

# Problem:
The problem addressed in this project was to enhance the operations of Plato's Pizza, a Greek-inspired pizza place in New Jersey, using data-driven insights. 
The owner's focus areas included sales performance, busy periods, seating capacity utilization, and product performance. The project aimed to provide a comprehensive report with data visualizations, offering insights into the restaurant's performance and identifying areas for improvement.

# Solution:
The high-level solution involved working with three sets of information in tables: Orders, Order Details, and Pizzas. These tables contained data related to dates and times of orders, types, and quantities of pizzas ordered, and information about pizza sizes, prices, and types. 
The approach was to analyze this data and create visualizations that would offer a clear overview of the restaurant's performance. 
The goal was to provide actionable insights for the owner to optimize operations.

# How I Approached It:
The approach started with a thorough analysis of the Orders, Order Details, and pizza tables, extracting relevant information about sales performance, busy periods, and product popularity. Visualizations were then created to represent the findings effectively. The focus was on identifying peak times, busy days, and less popular menu items. 
This involved utilizing data visualization techniques to present actionable insights that could guide decision-making and improvements in operations.

# What I Found:
Two peak times were identified ‚Äì during lunch and dinner. Fridays emerged as the busiest days.
Limited orders were observed before 11 am and after 10 pm, suggesting a potential consideration for adjusting operating hours.
The Brie Carre pizza was found to be unpopular, potentially due to uncommon ingredients. 
Removing it from the menu was suggested to help manage stock more efficiently.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, the project successfully addressed Plato's Pizza's operational challenges by providing data-driven insights. The analysis revealed crucial information about peak times, busy days, and less popular menu items, offering the owner actionable insights for improvement. The use of data visualizations enhanced the clarity and accessibility of the findings, ensuring that the owner could make informed decisions to optimize the restaurant's performance.
